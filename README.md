"# Mod6_1" 

I changed Update() in both scripts to FixedUpdate() to make the motion of the player and the camera smoother. I'm ot sure it's obvious from the screencast.

In FirstPersonCamera script, I added camera speed and sensitivity. It seems to me that it the sensitivity needs to be adjusted to user's mouse sensitivity preferences.

Both project and movie files are too big to be transfered to git. I'll place a link in the submission comment
